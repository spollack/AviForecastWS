i've downloaded the danger scale icons. they are PDFs. source is: http://www.avalanche.org/zip/Danger_Scale_Icons.zip

KMZ/KML files for regions:
    all of Canada: http://avalanche.ca/kmz/bulletinregions.kmz
    NW: would need to define. could base on NW region map: http://www.nwac.us/media/images/avalanche-map-small.jpg but would be manual work.

notes on regions:
----------
Canada:
* 12 regions with regular CAC forecasts
* 2 regions under CAC, but with no real forecasts (Bighorn, North Rockies)
* 4 from pc.gc.ca for national parks
* 3 independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)


basic app design concept:
----------
* overview map
    * uses the map view, zoomed out a ways, hybrid view mode; center on user's current location
    * overlay regions based on current "bottom line" avalanche forecast color (and/or icon)
    * click a region to drill to details
* details pages
    * shows the detailed forecast information for that region (including forecast timestamp, avalanche roses if available, etc.)
    * exact details will depend on the forecasting region
* information page
    * shows the level definitions, etc.


things to do:
----------
WS
    add more regions to regions.json
        use Google Earth to draw regions and get KML; or see if NWAC writes back
    app naming
        rename Heroku app (aviforecastws) -- "heroku rename newname"
        shorten version/1 to v1
        update client URLs, and push out new build
    support other avi centers beyond nwac
    set up unit tests (via Mocha) for the web scraping piece, with examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases
    remove console messages for happy path, or switch to a real logger and turn down (via Winston)
    scale testing?
iOS
    after adding more regions
        management of multiple concurrent network requests?
        track and throttle global refreshes (don't refresh if already done within the last few seconds)?
        user performance acceptable?
    design and implement real UI layout
    readable layout on non-retina displays
    info page(s)?
    drill down to details page?
    offline caching?
    iOS4 support?
    liability warning?
    ask for ratings?
    overlay avi symbols too?
    make toolbar completely transparent
    consider switching map to hybrid view mode, but if so change overlays to stand out better on this background
    startup screens
    check task switching behavior (viewDidUnload, etc.) -- what should get unloaded?
    check low memory behavior
    check no network behavior
    check no GPS behavior
    attributions?
    unit tests?
 other
    beta testing (TestFlight)
    ensure accuracy!
    work with NWAC; switch to their REST api when available
    contact other avalanche centers?
    LLC -- call and talk it through with the state
        LLC name? vs. trade names?
        what is through BLS vs. sec of state?
        annual fees and requirements?
        any other structural documents required?
        how long does it take to get set up?
        do i need to shut down the old business? or does it get transformed?
        updating Seattle biz license
        anything else i need to know?
    set up www.sebnarware.com website (via brinkster; see https://help.brinkster.com/KB/a125/how-do-i-redirect-a-domain-or-subdomain.aspx)
    update my developer account with Apple for business name?
    paid or free? thinking free
    submit app to Apple
    marketing
future possibilities
    push notifications
    weather info
    telemetry info
    add previous days to view history
    more avi info
    field tools (inclinometer, etc.)
    Android version
