i've downloaded the danger scale icons. they are PDFs. source is: http://www.avalanche.org/zip/Danger_Scale_Icons.zip

KMZ/KML files for regions:
    all of Canada: http://avalanche.ca/kmz/bulletinregions.kmz
    NW: would need to define. could base on NW region map: http://www.nwac.us/media/images/avalanche-map-small.jpg but would be manual work.


basic app design concept:
----------
* overview map
    * uses the map view, zoomed out a ways, hybrid view mode; center on user's current location
    * overlay regions based on current "bottom line" avalanche forecast color (and/or icon)
    * click a region to drill to details
* details pages
    * shows the detailed forecast information for that region (including forecast timestamp, avalanche roses if available, etc.)
    * exact details will depend on the forecasting region
* information page
    * shows the level definitions, etc.


things to do:
----------
WS
    serve regions.json
    support other avi centers beyond nwac
    set up unit tests (via Mocha) for the web scraping piece, with examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases
    remove console messages for happy path, or switch to a real logger and turn down (via Winston)
    scale testing?
iOS
    parse regions.json to create initial objects
    fetch regions.json
    management of multiple concurrent network requests
    track and throttle global refreshes (don't refresh if already done within the last few seconds)
    clean up MVC separations
    design and implement real UI layout
    readable layout on non-retina displays
    user performance acceptable?
    info page(s)?
    drill down to details page?
    offline caching?
    iOS4 support?
    liability warning?
    ask for ratings?
    add yesterday? day after tomorrow?
    overlay avi symbols too?
    make toolbar completely transparent
    consider switching map to hybrid view mode, but if so change overlays to stand out better on this background
    startup screens
    check orientation settings
    check task switching behavior (viewDidUnload, etc.) -- what should get unloaded?
    check low memory behavior
    check no network behavior
    check no GPS behavior
    attributions?
    unit tests?
 other
    beta testing (TestFlight)
    ensure accuracy!
    work with NWAC; switch to their REST api when available
    contact other avalanche centers?
    LLC? or just add "Sebnarware" or similar to my existing biz license?
    paid or free? thinking free
    submit app to Apple
    marketing
future possibilities
    push notifications
    weather info
    telemetry info
    more avi info
    field tools (inclinometer, etc.)
    Android version
