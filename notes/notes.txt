things to do as time allows:
--------------------
marketing
    update marketing email
    send to avalanche class instructors
    send to professional avalanche organizations (National Avalanche Center, etc.)
    send to ski/snowboard/backcountry mags: Backcountry Magazine, Coast Mountain Culture, ...
    send to hiking/climbing orgs/mags: WTA, AAJ, Rock&Ice, Climbing, Alpinist, etc.
    find groups in other areas (BC, Canadian Rockies, Colorado, Utah, etc.) to send info to
    get app reviewed on app review sites
    get folks to write reviews, update their own reviews, and to mark reviews as helpful
    flesh out sebnarware.com website with more app info
business
    transfer money into account once bank-to-bank transfer enabled
    switch biz expenses to biz account
WS
    get access to NWAC JSON api
        sent email to Jorie/Mark, waiting for response
        sent email to Benj, waiting for response
    auto-validation of each generated forecast
        test for aviLevel available and != 0 specifically for current time, for all regions (minus known exceptions)
        test for date gaps in the forecast, or aviLevel == 0 in the middle of a date range (vs. at the end, which is ok)
        on error, capture all inputs, and alert me
        also snapshot user URL vs. data URL vs. my forecast always, for later review
        add automatic, ongoing checks of HTML vs. CAAML results for all api-based sites?
    UAC integration
        enable parsing of "tomorrow" forecasts as well, once Brett is ready
        consider rolling over forecasts into the next morning?
            would be good for early mornings before forecasts are issued, but could be confusing for regions/days where new forecast will NOT be issued...
    support other avi centers -- send integration email to not-yet-integrated avalanche organizations!!!

        Mount Washington NH
        Crested Butte (CBAC): http://www.cbavalanchecenter.org/ -- NOTE this is within the CAIC Gunnison zone; based on email with CAIC, skip it for now
    look at libraries for parsing HTML (look at emails from Shep, Doc)
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available and stable
    consider putting dataURL as a field in regions.json file, and getting it that way on server, along with other regionDetails properties?
    any way to launch unit tests from WebStorm? (opened ticket with JetBrains)
    update linked components?
    not getting heroku log messages in loggly (could switch to heroku loggly add-on for this, but lower data limit and retention time, or paid)?
    in fall 2012, contact all avi centers again to see if there have been any changes, etc.
iOS
    info
        add more usage info, in terms of what "no rating" means, using your brain out there, etc.
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via facebook, twitter?
    more data at-a-glance
        show the danger rose as an icon on the map too within each region?
        click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)?
    add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast? have it do a full reload of the regions too?
    add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
    add system message capability, to send dynamic messages to users
    offline mode
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
        say when data was cached, for every page?
    cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
        do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
        note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
        see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
        store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
        could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
        load new file before proceeding
        make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
        preload cache at app install
        get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
        OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
            although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
        relead regions.json periodically in app (for case where people don't restart the app/phone regularly)
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger scale definition view
    get app rotation working in all views
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    add a "help your avalanche center" feature to take you to donation pages?
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    add more avi reference info?
    show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    have version numbers for disclaimer accepted (use app version number)?
    make iPad experience better?
additional versions to consider
    Android version
    WinPhone version
    website version (leverage the aggregation/normalization)

avalanche forecast center intro/integration blurb:
--------------------
Hello,

I've recently developed a free iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecasting centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map, based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

You can read more about the application, including reviews, and download it here: http://itunes.apple.com/app/avalanche-forecasts/id501231389?mt=8

I currently have it working with the NWAC (Northwest US), CAIC (Colorado), UAC (Utah), CAC (Canada), and Parks Canada forecasting centers (49 regions total). My goal is to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.

I'd like to get your forecast center integrated. Would you please connect me with your technical point of contact?

In order to integrate technically, there are two elements i'll need:
1) forecast region definitions: do you happen to have a KMZ file (or any similar geographic data file) that describes the borders of each of your forecast regions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? If not, i can work with you to create this.
2) forecast data: I can pull the forecast information by parsing your web pages, but if you have a CAAML feed or other API that you would prefer i use, that would be great.

Thanks for your help.
