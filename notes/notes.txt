    fix use of config.js
    use HTML parsing library (cheerio) as opposed by regexs
    update to current semantics (0.2.x not 0.1.x) with xml2js
    create server-oriented regions config file (for dataURL, parser, validation exceptions, etc.), to pull cases out of code
    set up real (remote) git
    auto-validation: check and refine results
    capture all generated forecasts (for example, in S3)?
    further auto-validation of each generated forecast
        validate by time of day (e.g. forecast should be issued by 8am or whatever)
        have classes of validation (issued daily vs. irregularly, issued day before vs. morning of, etc.)
        on error, capture all inputs, and alert me
        also snapshot user URL vs. data URL vs. my forecast always, for later review
        add automatic, ongoing checks of HTML vs. API results for all api-based sites?

        CAIC pages look messed up
        refresh forecasts after coming back from phone being asleep, but with app still in foreground (re-think what happens at what lifecycle phases)
        reduce battery drain via turning off location services after we get a fix (verify issue and solution via testing first)
        test & improve offline caching
            do longer term test of offline caching -- do things expire? 
            problem caching CAIC pages (although other ones seem to work fine)
        swap top and bottom bars?
        allow "show my location" to be disabled? 
        new features
            [see iOS list]
        low pri issues
            danger scale view should zoom to fill screen by default (based on orientation)
            title bar shows up in different colors on different android versions
            fix info icon within menu to use explicit resource, vs. system resource that looks different on each platform
                (tried it, but getting dark icon on dark background; so either leave it, or change one the icon color, or the background color)
            blue dot doesn't always show (even though map does position correctly) on Gingerbread; ok on ICS/JB
                test again with my revised FixedMyLocationOverlay, that always does the drawing
            in case of first time app use with no network, app must be shut down to try again once there is network
        further map performance tuning (if needed)
            investigate keeping path, and transforming via matrix to pan or scale
            split up path calc per OSM approach
                http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6630868/android-map-drawing-performance-1k-drawings
                http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/source/browse/trunk/osmdroid-android/src/org/osmdroid/views/MapView.java?r=790
            simplify polygons (point thinning when zoomed out)
            consider creating my own overlay manager class, to unify top-level logic
iOS
    v1.3
        usability
            map zoom level is different on iPhone 5 device ... Apple responded and explained why, try tweaking settings to make it more consistent
            momentarily highlight region that was tapped
            put region name in title for detailed forecasts
            make launch screen say "Avalanche Forecasts" not "Avalanche", to match branding
        info section
            change info button to bring up a table of topics (master/detail), not a pop-up
            add link to webpage that shows all partners, etc.
            add more usage info, in terms of what "no rating" means, using your brain out there, etc.
            add info on human factors and decision making -- find good reference
        sharing
            make it easy to share (virally) via facebook, twitter
        flurry
            update sdk
            add tracking for setting timeframe mode; for no location available
            review set of events overall
    v2
        status bar (or pop-ups of some sort?)
            add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
                need to think through how to handle multiple messages, no messages, etc.
            add alert/feedback if there are no avalanche forecast regions near your current position
            add more prominent loading spinner for when loading regions/forecasts
            add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case) (System Font size 13; label height 18)?
        offline mode improvements
            say when cached data is being used
            offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
            really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
            say when data was cached, for every page?
    v3
        add system message capability, to send dynamic messages to users (e.g. problem with forecast center X; forecast center Y added; etc.)
        more data at-a-glance
            show the danger rose as an icon on the map too within each region?
            click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
            label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
        cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
            do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
            note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
            see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
            store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
            could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
            load new file before proceeding
            make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
            preload cache at app install
            get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
            OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
                although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
            reload regions.json periodically in app (for case where people don't restart the app/phone regularly)
        feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
        add a "help your avalanche center" feature to take you to donation pages?
        add more avi reference info?
        add weather info?
        add telemetry info?
        show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
        add push notifications?
        get app rotation working in all views (or at least danger scale definition view)?
        make iPad experience better?


avalanche forecast center intro/integration blurb:
--------------------
[Avalanche Forecasts mobile app integration]

Hello,

Earlier this year I developed a free iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecasting centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map (following the standard North American danger scale), based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

You can read more about the application, see screenshots, read reviews, and download it here:
http://itunes.apple.com/app/avalanche-forecasts/id501231389?mt=8

I currently have it working with the NWAC (Northwest US), CAIC (Colorado), UAC (Utah), CAC (Canada), VIAC (Vancouver Island), and Parks Canada forecasting centers (50 forecast regions total so far). My goals over time are to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America, as well as to bring this to other mobile platforms beyond iOS (with Android being next on that list).

In preperation for the coming snow season, I'd like to get your forecast center integrated. Would you please connect me with your technical point of contact?

In order to integrate technically, there are two elements i'll need:
1) forecast region definitions: do you happen to have a KMZ file (or any similar geographic data file) that describes the borders of each of your forecast regions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? If not, i can work with you to create this.
2) forecast data: do you have a CAAML feed or other API that i can use to pull forecast information? Alternatively I can extract the forecast information by parsing your web pages, but a structured data feed is the much more robust approach.

Thanks for your help!

Seth

ps: A word on my motivations: i'm doing this project as a free service to the outdoors community, because i feel getting the avalanche forecast information out there broadly, consistently, and in an easy-to-consume fashion is so important. Many of us (myself included) have lost friends to avalanches. Anything we can do to get the information out there, so that people are armed to make good decisions, feels important and valuable. Plus its a fun project!

pps: if you'd like to chat, my cell is 206-553-9420.

I'd like to spread the word more broadly about this app within the avalanche/backcountry community. If you can help via an email out to the AIARE instructors, that would be fantastic. Also, any additional introductions you can help with, such as with the AAA and the National Avalanche Center, would be great.

Thanks for your help!
