things to do:
----------
 business
    change my developer account with Apple from individual to business (in progress)
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank; talk to Mike Napier (left message)
    update Seattle business license
    set up sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com website
        marketing page
        support page
    set up sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com emails -- test once DNS propagates; check junk mail folder
    EULA?
    paid or free? thinking free initially (maybe do pro version later)
    take screenshots, and trim off status bars (should be 640x920, down from 640x960)
    app store optimization (http://www.mobiledevhq.com/ -- help with keywords, etc.)
    write app marketing blurb
    submit app to Apple via iTunes Connect
    marketing
WS
    testing
        build more unit tests
        add examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        pc.gc.ca (4 regions)
        Canada independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)
        Utah
        Colorado
        other US (look at avalanche.org for details)
    operations
        scale testing?
        trending? (e.g. number of requests, # of users, etc.)
        monitoring? (e.g. pingdom; see what heroku has built-in)
        alerting?
iOS
    Several people did not realize that one needs to tap the forecast area to get the details...
        Some suggested putting some sort of icon (ie, danger level symbol) on the forecast zone would encourage one to tap it
        add an info page that gives instructions?
    data management
        combine the forecast lookups into one call
        performance is slow on older phones -- review flurry data after we've had a few days to gather it
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh? OR add forecasts last fetched time (but has to be across all forecasts)?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload...)?
        persistent cache
            divide into two persistent caches, must keep and want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
            limit size of purgable cache? probably not needed
            use cache contents even if network is available (either per regular cache rules; or as first data, before network data loads)?
    add "3 days out", for CAC? rename "today", [tue], [wed], [thu] or similar? but this makes NWAC look bad...
    after regaining focus
        recenter on user location?
        can i make regions not redraw until new data is actually present? is the mapview invalidating all the overlays itself?
    legend
        is it readable enough? looked just readable on iPhone 3G (consider taller&narrower font; hyphenated words)
        link from legend to info page (or have it slide down or pop up)?
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
    mapkit crash bug -- implement workaround? (seen this in the simulator, but never yet on a real device)

        see: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/48154
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    testing
        test on various iOS versions
        test on various device types
        check behavior on various networks (WiFi vs. 3G vs. Edge)
        check no network behavior
        test various cache cases
        check no GPS behavior
        check low memory behavior
future possibilities
    weather info
    telemetry info
    more avi reference info
    show previous days, for history
    push notifications
    consider updating shared components (client; server)
    Pro version of app
    Android version
    WinPhone version
    PhoneGap version
    iPad-specific version
    staging env
